# Black Face™ — Relationship and Separation Statement

Black Face™ is a governance and measurement infrastructure. It is intentionally structured to remain independent from data collection, data ownership, and commercial exploitation.

## 1. Structural Separation

Black Face™ does not directly collect data.

Any data used within Black Face™ benchmarks or evaluations is sourced from external entities operating under separate legal, operational, and financial control.

## 2. Independence from Data Collectors

Entities involved in data collection, including but not limited to Equinox Data Labs or any successor organization, operate independently from Black Face™ governance.

Such entities:

- do not control governance decisions
- do not influence benchmark design
- do not influence metrics or evaluation outcomes
- do not receive preferential access
- do not control publication or disclosure

Ownership, funding, or shared personnel does not override this separation.

## 3. Governance Authority

All governance authority resides within the Black Face™ governance framework, as defined by:

- the Governance Charter
- the Explicit Refusals
- the Transparency Commitments

No external entity may bypass or override these constraints.

## 4. Conflict of Interest Management

Potential conflicts of interest are:

- declared
- documented
- reviewed
- mitigated through governance controls

Where conflicts cannot be adequately mitigated, access or participation may be restricted.

## 5. Irrevocability

This separation is intentional and structural.

It cannot be removed, weakened, or bypassed through:
- commercial agreements
- partnerships
- funding arrangements
- operational convenience

Any change requires explicit, public governance updates.

Historical versions remain permanently accessible.
