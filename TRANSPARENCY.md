# Black Face™ — Transparency Commitments

Transparency is a core mechanism of accountability for Black Face™. Where full disclosure is not possible due to security, privacy, or misuse risk, transparency is provided through structured, auditable
summaries.

## 1. Governance Transparency

Black Face™ commits to publishing:

- its governance charter
- explicit refusals and misuse constraints
- governance updates and amendments
- historical versions of governance documents

No silent changes are permitted.

## 2. Decision Logging

Key decisions related to:

- access approvals
- access denials
- access revocations
- governance exceptions (if any)

are logged internally with timestamps and rationales.

## 3. Public Reporting

Redacted governance reports may be published periodically to disclose:

- the number of access requests received
- the number of approvals and denials
- categories of misuse prevented
- high-level enforcement actions taken

Reports are designed to maximize accountability while preventing reverse-engineering or abuse.

## 4. Dataset and Benchmark Transparency

Black Face™ commits to:

- publishing dataset and benchmark versions
- publishing change logs for each version
- preventing silent data replacement or metric modification

Historical versions remain accessible.

## 5. Limits of Transparency

Black Face™ does not disclose:

- sensitive security details
- individual-level data
- information that would enable misuse or circumvention
- access control mechanisms in exploitable detail

Transparency does not override safety.

## 6. Auditability

Where appropriate, Black Face™ supports:

- independent review
- third-party audits
- regulator-facing documentation

Audit access is governed by the same constraints defined in the charter.
