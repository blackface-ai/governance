# Black Face™ Governance Charter

## 1. Purpose

Black Face™ exists to provide a neutral, governance-first facial AI
measurement infrastructure focused on Black populations.

This project exists to measure, evaluate, and audit facial AI systems
under real-world conditions with fairness, accountability, and misuse
prevention as first-class constraints.

Black Face™ is not a dataset, not a commercial product, and not a
surveillance system.

## 2. Governance Before Technology

All governance rules, ethical constraints, and separation principles
are defined and published before:

- data collection
- benchmark creation
- model evaluation
- partnerships
- monetization

Governance precedes scale, incentives, and technical implementation.

## 3. Independence of Measurement

Black Face™ operates independently of:

- data contributors
- data collectors
- model developers
- commercial users
- government or institutional clients

Ownership, funding, or partnership does not grant influence over
benchmark design, metrics, access decisions, or results.

## 4. Scope of Authority

This charter governs:

- all datasets under Black Face™ governance
- all benchmarks and evaluation tasks
- all metrics and reporting
- all access and licensing decisions
- all publications and disclosures

No component of the system may bypass this charter.

## 5. Irrevocability and Versioning

Once published:

- governance rules may only be changed through explicit updates
- no silent modification is permitted
- all prior versions remain publicly accessible

Governance history is permanent and auditable.

## 6. Misuse Prevention

Black Face™ explicitly forbids uses that enable:

- surveillance
- biometric identification
- law enforcement targeting
- military or intelligence applications
- social scoring or population control

Detected misuse triggers access review and potential revocation.

## 7. Transparency and Accountability

Governance decisions are:

- logged
- reviewable
- auditable

Redacted governance summaries may be published to ensure public
accountability without exposing sensitive operational details.

## 8. Binding Effect

This charter is binding on:

- founders
- contributors
- partners
- licensees
- future governing bodies

Participation implies acceptance of these constraints.
