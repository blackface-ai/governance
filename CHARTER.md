# Black Face™ Governance Charter

## 1. Purpose

Black Face™ exists to provide a neutral, governance-first facial AI measurement infrastructure with an initial focus on populations in Africa that have been historically underrepresented, mismeasured, or excluded in facial AI systems.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Black populations
- lighter-skinned African populations
- mixed and diverse African skin tones
- other underrepresented skin-tone groups where documented measurement gaps exist

This project exists to measure, evaluate, and audit facial AI systems under real-world conditions with fairness, accountability, and misuse prevention as first-class constraints.

Black Face™ is not a dataset, a commercial product, or a surveillance system.

The infrastructure is designed to be extensible to broader populations
over time, under the same governance, fairness, and misuse-prevention
constraints defined in this charter.

Population inclusion is governed by measurement needs and documented performance gaps in the system, not by identity classification alone.

## 2. Governance Before Technology

All governance rules, ethical constraints, and separation principles are defined and published before:

- data collection
- benchmark creation
- model evaluation
- partnerships
- monetization

Governance precedes scale, incentives, and technical implementation.

## 3. Independence of Measurement

Black Face™ operates independently of:

- data contributors
- data collectors
- model developers
- commercial users
- government or institutional clients

Ownership, funding, or partnership does not grant influence over benchmark design, metrics, access decisions, or results.

## 4. Scope of Authority

This charter governs:

- all datasets under Black Face™ governance
- all benchmarks and evaluation tasks
- all metrics and reporting
- all access and licensing decisions
- all publications and disclosures

No component of the system may bypass this charter.

## 5. Irrevocability and Versioning

Once published:

- governance rules may only be changed through explicit updates
- no silent modification is permitted
- all prior versions remain publicly accessible

Governance history is permanent and auditable.

## 6. Misuse Prevention

Black Face™ explicitly forbids uses that enable:

- surveillance
- biometric identification
- law enforcement targeting
- military or intelligence applications
- social scoring or population control

Detected misuse triggers access review and potential revocation.

## 7. Transparency and Accountability

Governance decisions are:

- logged
- reviewable
- auditable

Redacted governance summaries may be published to ensure public accountability without exposing sensitive operational details.

## 8. Binding Effect

This charter is binding on:

- founders
- contributors
- partners
- licensees
- future governing bodies

Participation implies acceptance of these constraints.
