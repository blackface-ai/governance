# Black Face™ — Explicit Refusals

Black Face™ defines its legitimacy not only by what it enables, but by what it permanently refuses to do.

The following uses are explicitly and irrevocably forbidden.

## 1. Surveillance

Black Face™ will not support:
- real-time facial surveillance
- passive monitoring of individuals
- crowd tracking or population scanning
- persistent identity observation

No exceptions.

## 2. Biometric Identification

Black Face™ will not be used for:
- identifying individuals by name or identity
- facial recognition systems
- identity verification or authentication
- watchlists, lookup databases, or face matching

Measurement is not identification.

## 3. Law Enforcement and Military Use

Black Face™ will not support:
- policing systems
- predictive enforcement
- border control targeting
- military or intelligence applications
- threat identification or targeting

No authority overrides this refusal.

## 4. Social Scoring and Profiling

Black Face™ will not enable:
- social credit systems
- behavioral ranking
- trust or risk scoring
- profiling of individuals or populations

## 5. Silent Repurposing

Black Face™ will not allow:
- downstream use outside the agreed scope
- silent model retraining on governed data
- secondary usage without disclosure
- re-identification through aggregation

## 6. Commercial Override

Commercial interest, funding, or partnerships do not override governance constraints.

Access may be revoked at any time if misuse is detected.

## 7. Irrevocability

These refusals:
- cannot be bypassed
- cannot be softened quietly
- can only be changed through explicit, public governance updates

All historical versions remain permanently accessible.
